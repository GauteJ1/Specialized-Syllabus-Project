\section*{Conclusions}
The two parts of this project shows how we can utilize tensor decompositions and CMTF to analyze different datasets and discover the underlying patterns.
In part 1, we were able not only to discover the number of relevant chemicals in the mixtures, but also gather information about their properties, which in turn would allow us to identify the chemicals if they were unknown.
Part 2 demonstrate how coupled tensor matrix factorizations can use discover common factors across multiple datasets coupled in a single mode.
This allows us to explore more complicated underlying patterns across data gathered through different experiments.
The uniqueness property of the models ensures that the patterns found are indeed the "correct" patterns, and not a random set of factors that optimizes the mathematical problem.
